# Rosetta Pareto Front Tag Extractor

## Description
This script extracts and prints the design tags from a Rosetta Pareto front file as reported by the Pareto front ensemble metric. The Pareto front file typically contains designs ranked based on multiple objectives.

## Usage
```bash
python pareto_tag_list.py <pareto_front_file>
```

### Arguments
- `<pareto_front_file>`: Path to the Rosetta Pareto front file.

## Output
The script prints a space separated list of the design tags at the Pareto front to then use to extract those designs from a .silent file
